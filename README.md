# NN_Theory_Tester
This project is desined for testing  new algoirthms and experiments pertaining to neural networks. The top level modules
are designed for reuse, a sort of framework built on top of tensorflow 1.0. While frameworks such as Keras already exist, the
need for low level features meant I stuck to tensorflow, and the framwork grew organically from there. The packages under src
either pertain to a specific new algorithm/theory or a logical grouping of experiments. This README documents how this
repository can be used, before briefly getting in to the specifics of each package.
